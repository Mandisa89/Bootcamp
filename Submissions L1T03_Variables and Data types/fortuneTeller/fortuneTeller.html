    <h2>I am a fortune teller, let me tell you your fate.</h2>

    <!-- I used defer here so the html page would load first [Stackoverflow, 2010]
        Still it seems that the page's colours sometimes after page refresh, until the javascript is executed.
        I will look into that in the future. -->
