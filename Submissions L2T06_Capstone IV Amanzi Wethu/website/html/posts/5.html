    <h2>Gravel Wetland</h2>

    <p>
      When converting an existing chlorine pool to a natural pool one
      essentially has 2 options, you can either create a cost-effective floating
      wetland inside the pool OR you can construct a permanent gravel wetland
      inside and/or outside the pool.
    </p>

    <p>
      A gravel wetland can be added to any pool to convert it into a natural
      pool. This however requires the pool to be drained and for a retaining
      wall to be built to house the wetland and all the associated plumbing for
      the wetland. A wetland can be built inside or outside of the existing
      pool.
    </p>

    <ul>
      PROS
      <li>Looks better / has more gravitas</li>
      <li>Allows for more custom design & hardscaping in the pool</li>
      <li>A wider variety of plants can be grown</li>
      <li>
        Safer for children (as they cannot swim underneath any floating
        structures)
      </li>
      <li>
        You have the option to create a wetland outside of the pool swimming
        area thereby keeping all the surface area for swimming
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      CONS
      <li>Costs are much higher</li>
      <li>Needs to be auto-topped up to maintain the exact water level</li>
      <li>The pool has to be emptied and refilled</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      AVERAGE COST R80 000 - R400 000 The costs are much higher as one has to
      build permanent structures to hold gravel as well as redo all the
      plumbing, replace the pump, put in a pre-filter etc. The cost will vary
      depending on whether a pool needs repair, how large it is, and how
      ambitious the remodel is when it comes to decking, jetties, wetlands
      outside the pool, retaining structures etc.
