    <h2>Floating Wetland</h2>

    <p>
      When converting an existing chlorine pool to a natural pool one
      essentially has 2 options, you can either create a cost-effective floating
      wetland inside the pool OR you can construct a permanent gravel wetland
      inside and/or outside the pool.
    </p>

    <p>
      A floating wetland (as the name suggests) is a floating structure about
      150mm thick that can be used as a planting medium for aquatic plants. In
      time the plant’s roots grow 1 meter deep underneath the structure and this
      is where all the biological filtration happens. Floating wetlands utilize
      just the plant’s roots to create a biofilm matrix that cleans the water.
      35% of the pool’s surface area needs to be allocated to the floating
      wetland.
    </p>

    <ul>
      PROS
      <li>Very cost-effective</li>
      <li>Can be removed in future if required</li>

      <li>Can utilize existing plumbing and pumps</li>
      <li>Can be easily shaped or moulded to the sides or borders of pool</li>
      <li>Low environmental impact (less cement, gravel etc.)</li>
      <li>
        Water level can vary. This is important if you don’t plan to top the
        pool up in summer
      </li>
      <li>
        You can retain your current kreepy krawley and sand-filter to keep the
        pool floor clean
      </li>
      <li>Often the water in the pool can remain throughout the conversion</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      CONS

      <li>
        Takes longer to establish. It needs a one good growing season to mature
        and the pool will only reach a stable and clear state after that time.
      </li>
      <li>No option but to lose 35% of the pool surface area</li>
      <li>
        You will never get quite the same design freedom or aesthetic beauty as
        you do with a permanent wetland
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      AVERAGE COST R20 000 - R80 000 The costs are much lower as one can
      literally install the floating wetlands with the water in the pool. You
      can retain the same plumbing, sand filter and kreepy krawley. It is
      advised to put a low-energy pump in to circulate the water 24/7 and this
      can be done relatively simply.
