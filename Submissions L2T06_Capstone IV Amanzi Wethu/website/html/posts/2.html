    <p>
      Swimming in a Natural pool among flowering plants of lilies, iris and
      marsh marigolds is a celebration of life. Soothing your limbs and mind and
      skin and eyes, it seems every cell in your body is telling you - this is
      the way swimming should be. Natural Pools work entirely with nature to
      provide hygienic water for swimming.

    <p>
      Over the past five years, building my own pools and meeting experts on
      Natural Swimming Pools, I have re-thought the processes needed to create
      hygienic swimming water and I have come up with a system completely geared
      to fellow DIY pond builders. I try to minimise resources, incorporating
      reclaimed materials and I even make filters from reused household objects
      and domestic plumbing. In addition, my pools use a fraction of the
      electrical energy most Natural Swimming Pools require to maintain them.
      All of this is achieved without compromising healthy water. The water was
      recently tested and shown to be of drinking water quality. And of course,
      these pools have been designed to benefit wildlife - they are a nature
      reserve you can swim in! I hope by showing you how I've done it, you will
      be inspired to start digging for yourself.

      This pool is about 180m2 in total. The central swimming area is 4.5m
      x11.5m and 2.2m deep. It took me a couple of years of weekends and days
      off to complete and cost around 6000GBP.
