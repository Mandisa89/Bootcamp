    <h2>Organic Plunge Pool</h2>

    <p>
      The plunge pool is a proper organic pool (natural swimming pool), only
      smaller. And this one is small enough to fit in a modest garden to bring
      the delights of plunging into organic water to more of us.
    </p>
    <p>
      My kids love this pool; they feel comfortable learning to swim in deep
      water knowing they can reach the shallows with a single kick of doggy
      paddle and an outstretched arm. It is somehow manages to achieve being
      simultaneously cottage garden cosy and yet a sparkling wilderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      This pool covers an area of 48 squrare metres (6mx8m) with a 2.2m deep
      swimming or plunging zone measuring 4 metres by 2 metres. Come on one of
      my courses and I'll show you how you can make this organic pool.

      The plunge pool eight months after completion. I have moved the fence,
      built a little jetty over the filter and removed the architectural
      brutalism of the plank propped on concrete blocks. June 2011.
