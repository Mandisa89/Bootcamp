Thinking Like A Programmer - Pseudo Code


Compulsory Task 1

1.1

Pseudo code solution:

	
Ask user to enter random letter
Repeat request until user inputs a number
Determine how many of the letters were vowels
Output total number of vowels



1.2

Pseudo code solution:

Run through list of given numbers
Discard from list any numbers that are not integers (whole numbers, no fractions)
Integers may be positive, negative or equal to zero.
Sort all even numbers into new list
Sort all odd numbers into new list
Return average of all even numbers
Return average of all odd numbers



1.3

Pseudo code solution:

Input list of random names
Run through list to find all names starting with letter A
Group all names starting with that letter
Move group to top of new list
Run through list to find all names starting with letter B
Group all names starting with that letter
Add group of names to current end of new list (so under Group A)

Sidenote: 
There should be a way to iterate through the list of names with n+1?
If n= “A”, then n+1 would hopefully be “B”, n+2 would be “C”, etc.
